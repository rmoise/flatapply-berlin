# Login Scraper Migration Guide

## What Changed

We've replaced the regular scraper with a **login-based scraper** as the default. This provides:
- 90% fewer captchas
- Access to phone numbers
- Better rate limits
- Persistent sessions via cookies

## New Default Behavior

### CLI Commands
All `./crawl` commands now use login scraper by default:
```bash
./crawl incremental  # Uses login scraper
./crawl full        # Uses login scraper
./crawl light       # Uses login scraper
```

To force regular scraper (old behavior):
```bash
./crawl incremental --regular
```

### Scheduled Crawls
The scheduled crawler has been updated:
- **Old**: `run-scheduled-light-crawl.ts` (regular scraper)
- **New**: `run-scheduled-crawl.ts` (login scraper)

## Setup Requirements

### 1. Add WG-Gesucht Credentials
Add to `.env.local`:
```env
WG_GESUCHT_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
WG_GESUCHT_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### 2. Update Cron Jobs
If you have existing cron jobs, update them:
```bash
# Remove old cron jobs
crontab -l | grep -v "flatapply-berlin" | crontab -

# Setup new ones
./setup-cron.sh
```

## Migration Steps

### For New Users
1. Add WG credentials to `.env.local`
2. Run `./crawl test` to verify setup
3. Start using normally

### For Existing Users
1. Backup old cookies (if any):
   ```bash
   mv .wg-cookies.json .wg-cookies.json.backup
   ```

2. Add credentials to `.env.local`

3. Test login scraper:
   ```bash
   ./test-login-scraper.ts
   ```

4. Update any scripts referencing old files:
   - Replace `run-scheduled-light-crawl.ts` → `run-scheduled-crawl.ts`

## Benefits

| Feature | Old (Regular) | New (Login) |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Captcha Rate | ~50% | ~10% |
| Phone Numbers | ❌ | ✅ |
| Session Persistence | ❌ | ✅ |
| Rate Limits | Strict | Relaxed |

## Troubleshooting

### "Missing credentials" error
Add `WG_GESUCHT_EMAIL` and `WG_GESUCHT_PASSWORD` to `.env.local`

### "Login failed"
1. Verify credentials work on website
2. Delete `.wg-cookies.json` 
3. Try again

### Want old behavior back?
Use `--regular` flag:
```bash
./crawl incremental --regular
```

## Cookie Management

Cookies are saved in `.wg-cookies.json`:
- Created on first successful login
- Valid for ~30 days
- Delete to force fresh login

## Performance

With login scraper:
- First run: ~30s (includes login)
- Subsequent runs: ~10s (uses cookies)
- Captcha encounters: Rare

## Summary

The login scraper is now the default because it's:
- More reliable
- Has fewer captchas
- Provides better data
- Still 100% free

No action needed if you're happy with the change. Just add your credentials and enjoy fewer captchas!
